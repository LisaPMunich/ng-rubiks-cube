# Angular Rubik's Cube

## Description of the project
The Angular Rubik's Cube project is an implementation of the Kodierwürfel (Rubik's Cube) in Angular.
The Kodierwürfel is a simple encryption method used to encrypt and decrypt a text based on a secret word.
This project aims to simulate the encryption and decryption process of the Kodierwürfel.

## Goals and what I want to learn by implementing it
The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the Angular framework, including components, services, directives, and other core concepts.
Additionally, I aim to improve my skills in algorithm development, user interaction, debugging and testing, and the UI-framework primeNG.

## User stories
* As a user, I want to be able to encrypt a message using the Kodierwürfel method.
* As a user, I want to be able to decrypt a message using the Kodierwürfel method and the secret word.
* As a user, I want to have an interactive UI that allows me to input my secret word and message.

## Features
* Encryption and decryption of messages using the Kodierwürfel method
* User interaction to input secret word and message
* Debugging and testing to ensure correct functionality

## How to run it locally
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
* Run the command npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
* Run the command ng serve to start the development server.
* Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your browser to view the project.

**Note**: This project is still in development and the features mentioned above may not be fully functional yet.

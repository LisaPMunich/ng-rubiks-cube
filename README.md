# Angular Rubik's Cube

## Description of the project
The Angular Rubik's Cube project is an implementation of the Kodierwürfel (Rubik's Cube) in Angular.
The Kodierwürfel is a simple encryption method used to encrypt and decrypt a text based on a secret word.
This project aims to simulate the encryption and decryption process of the Kodierwürfel. The UI of this project was built using the UI-framework PrimeNG and PrimeFlex.

## Goals and what I want to learn by implementing it
The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the Angular framework, including components, services, directives, and other core concepts.
Additionally, I aim to improve my skills in algorithm development, user interaction, debugging and testing, and the UI-framework primeNG.

## User stories
* As a user, I want to be able to encrypt a message using the Kodierwürfel method.
* As a user, I want to be able to decrypt a message using the Kodierwürfel method and the secret word.
* As a user, I want to have an interactive UI that allows me to input my secret word and message.

## Features
* Encryption and decryption of messages using the Kodierwürfel method
* User interaction to input message and losungswort (secret word)
* Copy function to copy encoded message into the decode block
* Clear function to clear content of decode block
* Validation and error message for input of losungswort


Validation and error message for losungswort (using primeNG error messaging)
